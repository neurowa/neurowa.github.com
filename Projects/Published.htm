                <p style="font-size:13px"><a href="http://www.smrv-journal.com/article/S1087-0792(15)00069-6/abstract" target="_blank"><img src="Projects/Journals/SMR.png" class="img-responsive" style="float:right;padding:20px;max-height:200px" /></a><b>Aim:</b> It is well established that sleep disorders have neuropsychological consequences in otherwise healthy people. Studies of night-time sleep problems and cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD), however, paint a mixed picture, with many reporting no relationship between sleep problems and neuropsychological performance. This review aimed to meta-analyse this research and to examine the factors underlying these mixed results. </br></br><b>Methods:</b> A literature search was conducted of published and unpublished studies, resulting in 16 papers that met inclusion criteria. Data were analysed in the domains of: global cognitive function; memory (general, long-term verbal recognition, long-term verbal recall); and executive function (general, shifting, updating, inhibition, generativity, fluid reasoning).</br></br><b>Results:</b> There was a significant effect of sleep on global cognitive function, long-term verbal recall, long-term verbal recognition, shifting, updating, generativity, and fluid reasoning. Although there are effects on memory and executive function associated with poor sleep in PD, the effects were driven by a small number of studies. Numerous methodological issues were identified. </br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> Further studies are needed reliably to determine whether disturbed sleep impacts on cognition via mechanisms of hypoxia, hypercapnia, sleep fragmentation, chronic sleep debt or decreased REM and/or slow wave sleep in PD, as this may have important clinical implications.</p>

                <p style="font-size:13px"><a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10006122&fileId=S1443964615000194" target="_blank"><img src="Projects/Journals/BI.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="float:right;padding:20px;max-height:200px" /></a><b>Aim:</b> Partners of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have first-hand knowledge relevant to the management of the person with Parkinson's (PwP). If captured, this knowledge may improve effective care for the PwP. However, there is a lack of research focusing primarily on partners’ experiences of engagement with health professionals working in PD (HPPs). </br></br><b>Methods:</b> Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) was used to investigate the meaning of partners’ experiences of engagement with HPPs. Semi-structured interviews with 15 partners of PwP provided primary data. Each interview was digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed for emerging themes.</br></br><b>Results:</b> Three themes emerged: (i) partners’ lack of entitlement for their own needs to be met; (ii) submersion of self in the partnership and (iii) health professionals as agents of support. Additionally, sub-themes were identified, such as barriers to feeling entitled, setting up a premise for entitlement, and lost identity. Together, these themes highlight the current lack of focus on the partners of PwP. A process model was developed to describe partners’ cyclic progression through the various stages of their experience, and in the process, identifying initiatives for intervention. </br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> Given a lack of focus on the needs of partners of PwP, these preliminary insights could inform the delivery of improved services that support partners. This will ultimately benefit the PwP.</p>

However, the majority of people with PD experiencing mental health problems do not receive any professional treatment. </br></br><b>Methods:</b> A total of 327 Australian adults with PD completed a cross-sectional survey examining patterns of mental health service utilization and predictors of willingness to seek future mental health treatment.</br></br><b>Results:</b> Only 8% of participants were currently engaged in mental health treatment despite elevated levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The lifetime service use rate was also low at 24%. Logistic regression analysis showed that, second to prior treatment experience (odds ratio [OR] = 3.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.46-7.35), having had a discussion about psychological symptoms with a primary PD neurologist was the next most important predictor and tripled the likelihood of an individual being willing to seek future treatment, (OR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.72-5.27). </br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> This study highlights the integral role of the PD neurologist in facilitating awareness and treatment of mental health problems for individuals with PD.</p>

                <p style="font-size:13px"><a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1355617715000041" target="_blank"><img src="Projects/Journals/JINS.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="float:right;padding:20px;padding-top:0px" /></a><b>Aim:</b> A Movement Disorder Society (MDS) taskforce recently proposed diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease with features of mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). This study first examined the prevalence and nature of PD-MCI in a non-demented cohort using the MDS criteria. Using the generic Monte Carlo simulation method developed by Crawford and colleagues (2007), this study then estimated the base rate of the representative population who would demonstrate PD-MCI due to chance alone.</br></br><b>Methods:</b> A total of 104 participants with idiopathic PD underwent extensive motor and neuropsychological testing at baseline and 2 years later. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was used to assess motor symptoms of PD and a range of established neuropsychological tests was used to assess PD-MCI in accord with MDS criteria.</br></br><b>Results:</b> In accord with MDS criteria, 38% of this cohort demonstrated PD-MCI at baseline and 48% at follow-up. Of the 36 participants in the multiple-domain PD-MCI subtype at time-1, 9 (25%) demonstrated no PD-MCI at follow up. Analysis revealed that approximately 13% of the representative population would demonstrate abnormally low scores for 2 of the 9 tests used, thereby meeting MDS criteria for PD-MCI.</br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> Clinicians and researchers need to approach a single diagnosis (i.e., based on one assessment) of PD-MCI with considerable caution.</p>

Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) was used to examine the mediator model.</br></br><b>Results:</b> Depression and ADL significantly (<em>p</em>=.001) predicted HR-QOL, and depression significantly (<em>p</em>=.001) predicted ADL. Whilst ADL did not impact on the relationship between depression and HRQOL, there was a significant (<em>p</em>=.001) indirect effect of depression on HR-QOL via ADL, suggesting both direct and indirect (via ADL) effects of depression on HR-QOL. The magnitude of this effect was moderate (R<sup>2</sup> = .13).</br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> People with PD who report depression also experience greater difficulty completing ADL, which impacts upon their HR-QOL. It is recommended that clinicians adopt a multidisciplinary approach to care by combining pharmacological treatments with psycho/occupational therapy, thereby alleviating the heterogeneous impact of motor and non-motor symptoms on HR-QOL in people with PD.</p>

Eighteen adults with PD and a comorbid DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety were randomised to either Intervention (8-week group CBT treatment) or Waitlist (8-week clinical monitoring preceding treatment). The Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) was the primary outcome. Assessments were completed at Time 1 (pretreatment), Time 2 (posttreatment/post-waitlist) and 1-month and 6-month follow-ups.</br></br><b>Results:</b> At Time 2, participants who received CBT reported greater reductions in depression (Mchange = -2.45) than Waitlist participants (Mchange = .29) and this effect was large, d = 1.12, p = .011. Large secondary effects on anxiety were also observed for CBT participants, d = .89, p = .025. All treatment gains were maintained and continued to improve during the follow-up period. At 6-month follow-up, significant and large effects were observed for both depression (d = 2.07) and anxiety (d = 2.26).</br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> Group CBT appears to be an efficacious treatment approach for depression and anxiety in PD however further controlled trials with larger numbers of participants are required.</p>

Several alternative treatments have been suggested as potentially more viable alternatives including dopamine agonists, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</br></br><b>Methods:</b> A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials for depression and/or anxiety in PD was conducted to systematically examine the efficacy of current treatments for depression and anxiety in PD.</br></br><b>Results:</b> Nine trials were included. There was only sufficient data to calculate a pooled effect for antidepressant therapies. The pooled effect of antidepressants for depression in PD was moderate but non-significant (d = .71, 95% CI = −1.33 to 3.08). The secondary effect of antidepressants on anxiety in PD was large but also non-significant (d = 1.13, 95% CI = −.67 to 2.94). Two single-trials of non-pharmacological treatments for depression in PD resulted in significant large effects; Omega-3 supplementation (d = .92, 95% CI = .15 to 1.69) and CBT (d = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.07), and warrant further exploration.</br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> There remains a lack of controlled trials for both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for depression and anxiety in PD which limits the conclusions which can be drawn. While the pooled effects of antidepressant therapies in PD were non-significant, the moderate to large magnitude of each pooled effect is promising. Non-pharmacological approaches show potential for depression in PD however more research is required.</p>

Further, an individual's personality traits can influence the strategies they use to cope with a particular stressful situation. However, in PD, the interplay between personality traits, choice of coping strategy, and their subsequent effect on HRQoL remains unclear. The objective of this study was to examine whether personality (neuroticism and extraversion) indirectly affects HRQoL through the use of specific psychological coping strategies.  </br></br><b>Methods:</b> One hundred and forty-six patients with PD completed questionnaires on personality (Big Five Aspects Scale; BFAS), coping (Ways of Coping Questionnaire; WCQ), and mood-specific (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; DASS-21) and disease-specific HRQoL (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire; PDQ-39).</br></br><b>Results:</b>  After controlling for gender, age at diagnosis, and age at testing, the emotion-focused coping strategy of escape-avoidance was significantly correlated with neuroticism and certain aspects of HRQoL (cognitive impairment and social support). This suggests that neurotic personality traits may negatively impact on some aspects of HRQoL due to an increased use of escape-avoidance coping strategies. By contrast, planned problem-solving and escape-avoidance coping strategies were both significantly linked to extraversion and interpersonal and mood-related domains of HRQoL. This suggests that extraversion may positively impact on some aspects of HRQoL due to patients adopting greater planned, problem-solving coping strategies, and using fewer escape-avoidance coping mechanisms. </br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> Psychological interventions aimed at targeting maladaptive coping strategies, such as the use of escape-avoidance coping, may be effective in minimising the negative impact of neuroticism on HRQoL in PD. </p>

This study evaluated the benefits of exercise for cognitive functioning, mood and disease-specific QoL for people with PD. </br></br><b>Methods:</b> Twenty-eight individuals with PD were allocated to an exercise intervention program (EIP, n = 15) or control group (n = 13). The EIP group undertook a programme of progressive anabolic and aerobic exercise twice weekly for 12 weeks. The control group maintained their usual lifestyle.</br></br><b>Results:</b>  Exercise was shown to have selective benefits for cognitive functioning by improving frontal lobe based executive function. No significant effects were demonstrated for mood or disease-specific QoL. </br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> These results are consistent with previous research demonstrating selective benefits of exercise for executive function among normal ageing adults and PD.</p>
