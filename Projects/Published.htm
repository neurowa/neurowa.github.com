Multiple Regression Analysis (MRA) was used to examine the mediator model.</br></br><b>Results:</b> Depression and ADL significantly (p=.001) predicted HR-QOL, and depression significantly (p=.001) predicted ADL. Whilst ADL did not impact on the relationship between depression and HRQOL, there was a significant (p=.001) indirect effect of depression on HR-QOL via ADL, suggesting both direct and indirect (via ADL) effects of depression on HR-QOL. The magnitude of this effect was moderate (R<sup>2</sup> = .13).</br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> People with PD who report depression also experience greater difficulty completing ADL, which impacts upon their HR-QOL. It is recommended that clinicians adopt a multidisciplinary approach to care by combining pharmacological treatments with psycho/occupational therapy, thereby alleviating the heterogeneous impact of motor and non-motor symptoms on HR-QOL in people with PD.</p>

                <p style="font-size:13px"><a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S1355617715000041" target="_blank"><img src="Projects/Journals/JINS.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="float:right;padding:20px;padding-top:0px" /></a><b>Aim:</b> A Movement Disorder Society (MDS) taskforce recently proposed diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease with features of mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI). This study first examined the prevalence and nature of PD-MCI in a non-demented cohort using the MDS criteria. Using the generic Monte Carlo simulation method developed by Crawford and colleagues (2007), this study then estimated the base rate of the representative population who would demonstrate PD-MCI due to chance alone.</br></br><b>Methods:</b> A total of 104 participants with idiopathic PD underwent extensive motor and neuropsychological testing at baseline and 2 years later. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was used to assess motor symptoms of PD and a range of established neuropsychological tests was used to assess PD-MCI in accord with MDS criteria.</br></br><b>Results:</b> In accord with MDS criteria, 38% of this cohort demonstrated PD-MCI at baseline and 48% at follow-up. Of the 36 participants in the multiple-domain PD-MCI subtype at time-1, 9 (25%) demonstrated no PD-MCI at follow up. Analysis revealed that approximately 13% of the representative population would demonstrate abnormally low scores for 2 of the 9 tests used, thereby meeting MDS criteria for PD-MCI.</br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> Clinicians and researchers need to approach a single diagnosis (i.e., based on one assessment) of PD-MCI with considerable caution.</p>

                <p style="font-size:13px"><a href="http://www.smrv-journal.com/article/S1087-0792(15)00069-6/abstract" target="_blank"><img src="Projects/Journals/SMR.png" class="img-responsive" style="float:right;padding:20px;max-height:200px" /></a><b>Aim:</b> It is well established that sleep disorders have neuropsychological consequences in otherwise healthy people. Studies of night-time sleep problems and cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD), however, paint a mixed picture, with many reporting no relationship between sleep problems and neuropsychological performance. This review aimed to meta-analyse this research and to examine the factors underlying these mixed results. </br></br><b>Methods:</b> A literature search was conducted of published and unpublished studies, resulting in 16 papers that met inclusion criteria. Data were analysed in the domains of: global cognitive function; memory (general, long-term verbal recognition, long-term verbal recall); and executive function (general, shifting, updating, inhibition, generativity, fluid reasoning).</br></br><b>Results:</b> There was a significant effect of sleep on global cognitive function, long-term verbal recall, long-term verbal recognition, shifting, updating, generativity, and fluid reasoning. Although there are effects on memory and executive function associated with poor sleep in PD, the effects were driven by a small number of studies. Numerous methodological issues were identified. </br></br><b>Conclusions:</b> Further studies are needed reliably to determine whether disturbed sleep impacts on cognition via mechanisms of hypoxia, hypercapnia, sleep fragmentation, chronic sleep debt or decreased REM and/or slow wave sleep in PD, as this may have important clinical implications.</p>
